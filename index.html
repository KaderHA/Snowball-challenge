			<h2>About us</h2>

			<p>Donating money without knowing or seeing what it actually does for
				people can sometimes be hard. If only there was a way for us to see the
				effect our donations have on people in need. <br> </p>

			<p>We are a newly developed company that are collaborating with Save the
				Children to work towards the goal of ending world hunger. </p></section>

			<h2>The app</h1>

			<p>Introducing The Family app! This app makes it possible for you to donate
				from wherever you are to people in developing countries that need your help.
				Through this app you get assigned a family in a country of your choice.
				In return you get to see what the money gets spend on and get to see the
				difference your money makes. </p>

			<p>Through these difficult times you won’t be able to meet the family in
				person, but get to talk to them at least once a month. When this horrible
				pandemic is over it will of course be possible to meet the family yourself.
				There is also a function that makes it possible for multiple people to
				donate to one family as a group of 5 or less. The daily donation should
				be at least 10 kr but can’t be over 200 kr. This way you get to do a good
				deed every single day! You can ofc course quit donating whenever you like,
				all you have to do is end the subscription. <br> Make a difference today! </p></section>
